** Challenge mode implementation

What i want:

A new mode which is intended to be like many little mini challenges for the player

It should be like rounds or levels that you click and get a little information about what it is, and buttons to go into it or to leave back to the menu.

The UI should be like mario levels, where you advance to the next after beating the former. Level 1, level 2. When you click the "Challenge" Game mode, you should go into a new page where this is all layed out.

First of all All of these levels should have pet disabled and no extra upgrades allowed, this is a pure vanilla mode where its just you and the player.

Each round should have a premise, say you are only allowed 10 bullets to kill everything that spawns, or that there is 2 bosses in one room.

When you beat a challenge round, you should of course get an achievment. They should be named according to the battle you just faced. Lets start with "Boss killer" "Split Attention" and "No Shots, No Problem".

Level 1(Boss Rush): Lets start by building the first challenge mode, it should be a boss arena. Make it super cool, lets do green hell theme. The premise is 2 bosses at once, the 2 bosses we have in the game right now. There should spawn 4 random pillars, the same ones we have already made. 

Level 2(Split Attention): It should be 1 Sentinel boss, accompanied by a swarm of super fast blue enemies, trying to split the attention of the player.

Level 3(No Shots, No Problem): Make it a limited amound of reload rounds, and force the player to have a high accuracy to beat this mode, No pet allowed in this round.

Level 4 (Glass Cannon): Your HP is set to 1 and you have to complete wave 1-10 Without dying. This is supposed to be a dodge test.
